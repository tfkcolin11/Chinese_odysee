## Introduction

Chinese Odyssey is a language learning application designed to help users practice and improve their Chinese language skills through interactive conversations with an AI language partner. The app provides scenario-based learning experiences tailored to different HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) proficiency levels, allowing users to practice in realistic contexts.

The application is built using Flutter and follows a clean architecture approach with Riverpod for state management. It supports both online and offline modes, ensuring users can continue learning even without an internet connection.
